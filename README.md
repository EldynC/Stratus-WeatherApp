# Stratus-WeatherApp
This is a skeleton of a weather app I created for a project in my CS1200 class at UTD.

The app was made using OpenWeatherAPi, Android Studio, Java, XML, Picasso(for image downloading) and Postman.

## App Walk-though
Unfortunately, imgur does not capture the best quality when the gif renders
but here is the functioning prototype of the app.
